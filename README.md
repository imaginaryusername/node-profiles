# Node profiles for [SporeStack](https://sporestack.com)

Launch with: `sporestack spawn --sporestackfile file.json`

## Tips

* Use `sporestack sporestackfile_helper` to help create the json files. Use `sporestack json_extractor` to help disassemble the json files.
* Don't set a dcid unless it's really necessary.
* Set days to something reasonable. If it's going to be a server for a day, set it to 1. If it's only useful being up for a long time, set it to 28.
